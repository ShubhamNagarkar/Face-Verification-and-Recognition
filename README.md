# Face-Verification-and-Recognition

<h3> Face Verification </h3>
* "Is this the claimed person?". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. 
* A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem.

To address this problem, the system uses pre-trained Inception network to encode 96x96 RGB images to 128-dimensional vector to perform 1:1 Face Verification.
